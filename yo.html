                              <p>   A frappuccino is a blended iced coffee drink that is topped with whipped cream and
                                    syrup. Made famous by Starbucks, there are endless potential variations of this cold

                              <p> Robusta coffee beans have almost twice as much caffeine as Arabica beans. These high
                                    caffeine levels are part of what protects the plant against disease. Robusta coffee
                                    beans have a heavier body, low acidity, and smooth texture. Coffee made from Robusta
                                    beans often is often described as having hints of chocolate. This coffee tastes even
                                    better when cream and sugar are added.
